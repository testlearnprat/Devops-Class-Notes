Explain your Branching strategy of your project or release activity or release architecture

Branches can be created for multiple reasons. Here we create branches for release. Development will 
be going on the dev branch, so once the code is ready on the dev branch for the first release, we 
create a release number one branch  and we make a release from the release one branch and 
this branch acts as a maintainance branch for the first release. that means whateve the issuses 
related to the first release will be fixed on release one branch and parelley developement will be 
going on dev branch for the second release once the code is ready for the second release on the dev 
branch before we create release 2 branch we merge release 1 branch to dev branch. 
Then we create branch for second release from the dev branch

whatever the issuses that we have seen in previous releases that should not be visible in the next release.
